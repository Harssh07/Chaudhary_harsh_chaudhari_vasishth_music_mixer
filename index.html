    <!-- Dev note -->


 <!-- NOTE: We have already collected high-quality hip-hop music samples for five beats.

 TODO: Design a user interface (UI) for beat selection and drag-and-drop.
Our goal is to create an intuitive interface where users can select beats and easily drag them onto specific places.

TODO: Implement drag-and-drop functionality.
 We will enable users to drag the selected beats and drop them onto designated areas for seamless interaction.

TODO: Develop playback functionality.
 Once a beat is dropped onto a specific area, it will trigger the playback of the corresponding music sample.

 TODO: Test and refine the user experience (UX).
We will rigorously test the drag-and-drop interaction and ensure accurate beat playback for a smooth user experience. -->
